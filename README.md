The [Northrop Grumman Collaboration Project] presents the Ground Control Station. This project's objective is to view and set missions for all autonomous vehicle platforms in the project.

This is based on [Node.js], [React], [Webpack], and [Electron].

## Getting Started
**:pencil2: Setting Things Up**

Install [Node.js]. The program will not be able to run without it.

Open up your command line application and clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NGCP/GCS.git
```

**:scroll: Running the Program**

Create a [Mapbox account] and obtain a public API access token. Create a `.env` file, copy the content of the `.env.example` to it, and replace `your-access-token` with your own access token.

```sh
MAPBOX_TOKEN=your-access-token
```

Install all required third-party libraries and run the program:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```
